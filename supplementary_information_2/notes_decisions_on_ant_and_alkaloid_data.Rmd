#This file presents notes on decisions about ant and alkaloid data, as follows:

1. Aphaenogaster ants were considered to have alkaloids because they have anabaseine, which is analogous to the frog alkaloid noranabasamine (Daly et al., 2005).

2. Alkaloids were detected in Paratrechina steinheili (Saporito et al., 2004) and P. amblyops (Clark et al., 2005). These two species are now allocated in the genus Nylanderia (La Polla et al 2010). As a result, no Paratrechina as currently recognized were included in our study.

3. Carebarella, found to contain HTX (Jones et al., 2012), is now within Solenopsis (Pacheco & Mackay, 2013).

4. There does not appear to be a deohy-PTX class, but there is a deoxy-hPTX class (Daly et al., 2005). deohy-PTX seems to have been listed in error in Saporito et al. (2007).

5. Alkaloids 235B, 235B', and 235B'' were treated as 235B, following Daly et al. (2005).

6. Alkaloids 195A, cis-195A, trans-195A were treated as 195A, following Daly et al. (2005).

7. Alkaloid "321", itself detected in a single site, was included. Although it is no clear whether it represents alkaloid 321A, B, C, D, or E, this chemical is not present in other sites.

8. Alkaloid "325", itself detected in a single site, was excluded. The reason for this exclusion is that it is not clear whether it represents alkaloids 325 A, B, or C, which are present in other sites.

9. There is no 207H listed for any pop in the sup. material even if so in the main text. So total alk listed by Sapo are not 232, but 231.

10. Daly et al., 2005 report 237C (5,6,8-I) to be of ant origin, but Saporito et al., 2009 doesn't. We consider this to be a mistake in Daly et al., 2005 and do not treat 5,6,8-I as being of ant origin.

11. Clark et al., 2005 found alkaloid 225C in an ambiguous mixture of Camponotus and Pachycondyla ants, therefore we don't consider them alkaloid-harboring ants. 

12. Tricyclics were not excluded from analyses restricted to ant alkaloids because this class was found in African ants (Schroder et al., 1996).
