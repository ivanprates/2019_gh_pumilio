Decisions on ant and alkaloid data

This file presents notes on decisions about ant and alkaloid data, as follows:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  We considered *Aphaenogaster* ants to have alkaloids because they have anabaseine, which is analogous to the frog alkaloid noranabasamine (Daly *et al*., 2005).

2.  Alkaloids were detected in *Paratrechina steinheili* (Saporito *et al*., 2004) and *P. amblyops* (Clark *et al*., 2005). These two species are now allocated in the genus *Nylanderia* (La Polla *et al*., 2010). As a result, no *Paratrechina* (as currently recognized) were included in our study.

3.  *Carebarella*, found to contain HTX (Jones *et al*., 2012), is now within *Solenopsis* (Pacheco and Mackay, 2013).

4.  There does not appear to be a deohy-PTX class, but there is a deoxy-hPTX class (Daly *et al*., 2005). deohy-PTX seems to have been listed in error in Saporito *et al*. (2007).

5.  Alkaloids 235B, 235B', and 235B'' were treated as 235B, following Daly *et al*. (2005).

6.  Alkaloids 195A, cis-195A, and trans-195A were treated as 195A, following Daly *et al*. (2005).

7.  Alkaloid "321", itself detected in a single site, was included. Although it is no clear whether it represents alkaloid 321A, B, C, D, or E, this chemical is not present in any other site.

8.  Alkaloid "325", itself detected in a single site, was excluded. The reason for this exclusion is that it is not clear whether it represents alkaloids 325 A, B, or C, which are present in other sites.

9.  There seems to be no 207H listed for any sampled site in the Supplementary Information of Saporito *et al*. (2007), even if there is in the main text. The total number of alkaloids listed by Saporito *et al*. (2007) therefore seems to be 231 and not 232.

10. Daly *et al*. (2005) report 237C (5,6,8-I) to be of ant origin, but Saporito *et al*. (2009) do not. Following Saporito *et al*. (2009), we do not treat 5,6,8-I as being of ant origin.

11. Clark *et al*. (2005) found alkaloid 225C in an ambiguous mixture of *Camponotus* and *Pachycondyla* ants. Therefore, we conservatively do not consider them to be alkaloid-bearing ants.

12. Tricyclics were not excluded from analyses restricted to ant alkaloids because this class was found in African *Myrmicaria* ants (Schroder *et al*., 1996).
