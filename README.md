This repository contains information associated with the manuscript entitled:

**Links between prey assemblages and poison frog toxins: a landscape ecology approach to assess how biotic interactions affect species phenotypes.**

By Ivan Prates, Andrea Paz, Jason L. Brown, and Ana C. Carnaval.

The following information is provided:

1. R scripts used to prepare and filter the data and perform the analyses.

2. Matrices of alkaloid composition dissimilarity, estimated ant assemblage dissimilarity, genetic distances between poison frog populations, and geographic distances between sites.

3. Outputs from multiple matrix regression with randomization (MMRR) and linear regression analyses.

4. Supplementary Information:
- Text S1: Decisions on alkaloid and ant data.
- Table S1. Alkaloid data.
- Table S2. Ant locality data.
- Table S3. Optimized parameters used in individual species distribution models.
