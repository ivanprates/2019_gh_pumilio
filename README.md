The following information is provided:
- R scripts used to prepare and filter the data and perform all analyses.
- Matrices of alkaloid composition dissimilarity, estimated ant assemblage dissimilarity, genetic distances between _Oophaga pumilio_ populations, and geographic distances between sites.
- Outputs from multiple matrix regression with randomization (MMRR) and linear regression analyses.
- Supplementary Information 2: Decisions on alkaloid and ant data.
- Supplementary Information 4: Optimized parameters used in individual species distribution models.

Raw alkaloid (Supplementary Information 1) and ant locality data (Supplementary Information 3) to be included following article acceptance.
